##About Me
I am a web developer located in Altach, Austria, and I am working for [MASSIVE ART](http://www.massiveart.com),
where I develop the [Sulu CMF](http://www.sulu.io).

Additionally I am part of a team organizing a small web development user group in Vorarlberg, Austria,
called [VlbgWebDev](http://lanyrd.com/series/vlbgwebdev/).
