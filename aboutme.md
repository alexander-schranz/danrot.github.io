##About Me
I am a web developer located in Altach, Austria, and I am working for [MASSIVE ART](http://www.massiveart.com),
where I develop the [Sulu CMF](http://www.sulu.io). I am also still studying for my master's degree in
information technology at the [Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences](http://www.fhv.at).

Additionally I am part of a team organizing [VlbgWebDev](http://lanyrd.com/series/vlbgwebdev/), a small web development
user group in Vorarlberg, Austria.
