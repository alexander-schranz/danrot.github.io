title: My todo system
---
I have been reading the official Getting Things Done book by David Allen, and now I want to summarize the most important
lessons I have learnt. These tips work best when used in [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com), which is my favourite
todo app.

Maybe I should mention that I don't follow every advice from the book, because some of them seem too inconvenient to me.
The most important thing is to keep the system up to date, and nobody would do that, if he or she doesn't like the
procedure for it.

###Write everything down

###Introduce lists for your bigger project

###Use Hashtags for the required context

###Only mark real deadlines with a due date

###Don't be afraid to abuse the system for checklists
